# SplitShow #

A tool for the dual-head presentation of PDF slides on Mac OS X, most likely using a laptop and a projector. The project arose out of the need to correctly project slides created with LaTeX's [BEAMER class](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/).

# Wanted: New Project Owner(s) #
**Unfortunately, we don't have time to support SplitShow anymore, so we are looking for someone to take over. Please start a new issue if you are interested. Deadline: 2011-01-31**

## Dual-Head Full Screen Mode at Native Resolutions ##
Traditional PDF viewers require two displays to be in "mirror" mode in order to show the same image on both. The -- maybe not so obvious -- disadvantage of this is that the higher-resolution display is forced to used the resolution of the lower-resolution one. By keeping the two displays at their respective native resolutions in "extended desktop" mode, your slides will always look great on either side.
